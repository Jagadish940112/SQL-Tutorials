SELECT *

-- Subquery (SELECT)

SELECT EmployeeID, Salary,
(SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM EmployeeSalary) AS AvgSalary
FROM EmployeeSalary

-- PARTITION BY (without subquery yet same result as above)

SELECT EmployeeID, Salary,
AVG(Salary) OVER () AS AvgSalary
FROM EmployeeSalary

-- Why GROUP BY doesn't work

SELECT EmployeeID, Salary,
AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM EmployeeSalary
GROUP BY EmployeeID, Salary
ORDER BY 1,2

-- Subquery (FROM)

SELECT * -- if query from another table, use Temptable or CTE better
FROM (SELECT EmployeeID, Salary,
	  AVG(Salary) OVER () AS AvgSalary
	  FROM EmployeeSalary) AS A

-- Subquery (WHERE)

SELECT EmployeeID, JobTittle, Salary
FROM EmployeeSalary
WHERE EmployeeID in ( 
		SELECT EmployeeID

		WHERE Age > 30)
