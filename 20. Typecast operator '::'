In SQL, '::' is a typecast operator that allows you to explicitly convert a value of one data type to another data type.
The syntax of the typecast operator is as follows:

value::data_type

For example, if you want to convert a string to an integer, you can use the '::' operator as follows:

SELECT '123'::integer;

This will convert the string '123' to an integer value of 123.

The '::' operator is supported by many relational database management systems, including PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
However, note that the syntax and behavior of the typecast operator may vary slightly depending on the database system you are using.
