1. SELECT SUM(REVENUE) OVER () FROM kaggle.data GROUP BY channel;

The issue with this query is that it combines a window function (SUM(REVENUE) OVER ()) with a GROUP BY clause.
The GROUP BY clause is used to perform aggregate calculations (like SUM, COUNT, etc.) within each group separately.
In this case, you are trying to use a window function without any PARTITION BY clause, which means that it would be applied to the entire result set as one group. 
This results in ambiguity, as the window function tries to sum up all the groups' sums, but it cannot determine which grouping the sums belong to.

| channel | revenue |
|---------|---------|
| A       | 100     |
| A       | 200     |
| B       | 300     |
| B       | 400     |

With the GROUP BY channel clause, you'd get two groups:

Group 1 (channel = A): 100 + 200 = 300
Group 2 (channel = B): 300 + 400 = 700

But if you apply a window function without PARTITION BY like SUM(REVENUE) OVER (), the window function tries to sum up all the groups' sums:

Window Function Result: 300 + 700 = 1000

The issue here is that the window function does not know how to separate the sums of each group because there is no PARTITION BY clause.
As a result, the query is not valid in standard SQL.

2. SELECT SUM(SUM(REVENUE)) OVER () FROM kaggle.data GROUP BY channel;

In this query, you are using a nested SUM function inside the window function.
The inner SUM(REVENUE) calculates the sum of the REVENUE column within each channel group separately due to the GROUP BY channel clause.
Then, the outer SUM function (window function) applies to the result of the inner SUM(REVENUE) calculation for all groups defined by the GROUP BY clause.
This is allowed because the GROUP BY clause ensures that each group's sum is well-defined and unambiguous.

To summarize, the key difference is that the second query is allowed because the inner SUM calculation is done within each group due to the GROUP BY clause,
while the first query is not allowed because the window function is used without a PARTITION BY clause,
causing ambiguity in the grouping for the window function's calculation.
